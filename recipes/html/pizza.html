                <li>1 tsp Instant yeast</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>

                <li>handful fresh basil</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
        <h5>For the topping</h5>
                <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced</li>
                <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan</li>
                <li>handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <h5>To finish</h5>
                <li>handful of basil leaves (optional)</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
            <ol>
                    <li>Make the base: Put the four into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, our in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly foured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You have leave the dough to rise if you like, but it's not essential for a think crust.</li>
                    <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil, and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
                    <li>Roll out the dough: if you've let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a foured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two foured baking sheets.</li>
                    <li>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon.Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
